# Recurrent Neural Networks for Timeseries

### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/rnn by Data For Science.

From the closing price of the stock market to the number of clicks per second on a web page or the sequence of venues visited by a tourist exploring a new city, time series and temporal sequences of discrete events are everywhere around us. Understanding them requires taking into account the sequence of values seen in previous steps and even long-term temporal correlations. 

Learn how to use recurrent neural networks, a technique originally developed for natural language processing, to model and forecast time series. Youâ€™ll also discover the advantages and disadvantages of recurrent neural networks with respect to more traditional approaches.
